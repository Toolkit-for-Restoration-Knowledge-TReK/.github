# Toolkit for Restoration Knowledge (TReK)
## Overview
This project is an international collaboration between Canadian and German researchers to build a knowledge base for ecological restoration. This knowledge base will host structured, linked open data related to restoration ecology. 
We are developing a suite of tools to help researchers and practitioners annotate and share their data in ways that satisfy the [FAIR Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). The toolkit includes:
- **Racoon** (**R**estoration **a**nd **Co**nservation **On**tology): A version of the [Environment Ontology (ENVO)](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo) that is tailored towards restoration and conservation.
- **Racoon-kits**: A repository of [LinkML](https://github.com/linkml) templates for ecology datasets.
- **TReKdb**: A database to hold linked datasets as well as publications described with semantic annotations.
- **Modeling tools**: We will develop modeling tools (starting with [Futzy](https://github.com/Toolkit-for-Restoration-Knowledge-TReK/Futzy)) that directly use linked data.
